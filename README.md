# Mac_dictionaries
Dictionaries on Mac, such as Oxfort, Longman.   
MAC OS 自带词典可以添加第三方词典，非常强大，虽然不自带发音，但是可通过系统自带的发音功能读单词，选中单词右键点击菜单中有朗读。  
Golden dictionary 有Windows, Mac OS, Linux, Android等平台的版本，支持Mdict的mdx词典文件。    
但是在MAC OS上，一些第三方做的 朗文词典 与 牛津词典 音标字体出问题。需要下载安装 `Kingsoft Phonetic Unicode.ttf`，但是网上下载到的同名字体不支持MAC上的词典，无法解决音标乱码问题，经过多次搜索，终于寻得一个能用的字体文件，保存起来，以备以后使用。    



Mac os has a strong dictionary app that support 3rd party's dictionaries which can easily converted to *.dictionary file, and put in the ~/Library/dictionary/ folder.   
And golded dictionary is also a cross-platform app that support Windows, Mac OS, Linux, Android and so on. It's compatible with dictionary files such as Mdict's.   
But on Mac OS, some dictionaries have problems with phonetic symbol, which can be solved by install special font. Some version of Longman or Oxford dictionaries that made by some 3rd party need `Kingsoft Phonetic Unicode.ttf` to make phonetic symbol shows correctly. Some ttf file that has the same name toubled me a lot, and wasted my time until a good one is found. So I saved it here for some day.
